## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with ReadmeMaker, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. This project assumes a basic understanding of Python and its package management system, pip.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adityaadpandey/ReadmeMaker.git
   cd ReadmeMaker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   The project relies on various Python packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file. To install them, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

At this time, there are no additional configuration steps required to set up ReadmeMaker.

## 🎯 Usage

To use ReadmeMaker and generate a comprehensive README.md for your project:

1. **Run the main script**
   ```bash
   python main.py --repo <GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

Replace `<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze and generate a README file for.
